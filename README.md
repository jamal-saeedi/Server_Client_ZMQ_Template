# ZeroMQ Image Classification with TensorFlow 

This project demonstrates a template for using ZeroMQ to send an image to a server, receive a classifier prediction, along with a processed image, and print and show the results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- ZeroMQ
- Pillow 
- TensorFlow for the classifier (in this example, TensorFlow is used)
